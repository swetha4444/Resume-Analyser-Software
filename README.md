# Resume Analyser Software
A resume is a summarized document which represents a job seekerâ€™s professional background and skills for a prospective employer. The resume parser converts an unstructured form of resume data into a structured format, it extracts it into machine-readable output like CSV. Automated resume screening increases quality of hire by reducing false positives because candidates can't trick the system through keyword stuffing. It also reduces false negatives because candidates with good qualifications no longer slip through the keyword filters.
